	<h2>FAMILY PLANNING</h2>

India is the first country that launched a National Family Planning Programme in 1952, emphasizing fertility regulation for reducing birth rates to the extent necessary to stabilize the population at a level consistent with the socio-economic development and environment protection.  Since then the demographic and health profiles of India have steadily improved.
<p></p>Under this Scheme, the Govt. of India released compensation for Sterilization acceptors to both Female and Women. Women who had undergo Sterilization operation (Tubectomy) in the Government Hospital can get Rs. 600/- and Men who had undergo Sterilization Operation (Vasectomy) can get Rs. 1100/-.
<p></p>Under the existing government scheme no compensation was payable for failure of sterilization, and no indemnity cover was provided to Doctors/health facilities providing professional services for conducting sterilization procedures etc. There is a great demand in the States for indemnity insurance cover to doctors/health facilities, since many govt. doctors are currently facing litigation due to claims of clients for compensation due to failure of sterilization. This has led to reluctance among the doctors/health facilities to conduct Sterilization operations.   
<p></p>With a view to do away with the complicated process of payment of ex-gratia to the acceptors of Sterilization for treatment of post operative complications, incapacitation or death attributable to the procedure of sterilization, the Family Planning Insurance Scheme was introduced w.e.f  29th November, 2005 for a period of one year to take care of the cases of failure of Sterilization, medical complications or death resulting from Sterilization, and also provide indemnity cover to the doctor / health facility performing Sterilization procedure, as follows. But from 1st April 2013 onwards, Family Planning Indemnity Scheme was changed to Family Planning Indemnity Scheme and has been implemented at State:  
<ol>
<li>Death following sterilization in hospital or within 7 days from the date of discharge from the hospital. 				- 	Rs. 2 Lakhs
<li>Death following sterilization within 8 - 30 days from the date of discharge from the hospital. 				-	Rs. 50,000/-
<li>Failure of Sterilisation  		-	Rs. 30,000/-
<li>Cost of treatment upto 60 days arising out of complication from the date of discharge.  
</ol>
-	       Actual not exceeding Rs. 25,000/-

Indemnity Insurance per Doctor/facility but not more then 4 cases in a year. 
-	       Upto Rs. 2 Lakhs per Claim
